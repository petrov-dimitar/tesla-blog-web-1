<p>Today Model S was named Motor Trend’s 2013 Car of the Year, one of the automotive industry’s most coveted awards. To take top honors, Model S 
garnered a unanimous vote from the panel of Motor Trend judges and guest judges, considered among the savviest and toughest critics in the industry. 
This is the first time in Motor Trend’s memory that every judge was in unanimous agreement.
</br></br>
“Our aspiration with the Model S was to show that an electric car truly can be better than any gasoline car, which is a critical step towards 
the widespread adoption of sustainable transport,” said Elon Musk, Tesla Motors co-founder and CEO. “Nothing illustrates this more clearly than
 winning Motor Trend’s Car of the Year by unanimous decision against a field of exceptional competitors.”
</br> </br>
The 2013 field of competition included entries from some of the most historically dominant nameplates. The field was initially narrowed to 
11 finalists including the Porsche Boxster, BMW 3-series, Lexus GS, and Subaru BRZ. After extensive track and road testing pushed vehicles
 to their limits in one of the industry’s toughest tests of performance, efficiency, safety and more, the Tesla Model S was awarded top honors.

<b> About Model S</b>
</br>
</br>
Model S is the world’s first premium sedan built from the ground up as an electric vehicle and has been engineered to elevate the 
public’s expectations of what a premium sedan can be. At the heart of Model S is the proven Tesla powertrain, delivering both
 unprecedented range and a thrilling drive experience. With a rigid body structure, nearly 50/50 weight distribution and a remarkably 
 low center of gravity, Model S offers the responsiveness and agility expected from the world’s best sports cars while providing the ride 
 quality of a luxury performance sedan.
</br></br>
 

Setting the bar for electric driving range, Model S offers 40 kWh, 60 kWh and 85 kWh battery options. All deliver unprecedented range,
 with the 85 kWh variant achieving an EPA-certified range of 265 miles. All three batteries use automotive-grade lithium-ion cells arranged
 for optimal energy density, thermal management, and safety.
</br></br>
Without an internal combustion engine or transmission tunnel, the interior of Model S has more cargo space than any other sedan in its
 class and includes a second trunk under the hood. The Model S interior features a 17” in-dash touchscreen with Internet capabilities, 
 allowing for streaming radio, web browsing and navigation.
